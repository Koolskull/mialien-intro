					An inter-dimensional bridge between Network Spirituality and the Slimentologist Island of Stardrain on the planet FubbX+FN.

				<section>MiAlien Maker is a PFP collection of hand illustrated digital aliens in a similar format to Milady maker, Redacted Remilio Babies, and Radbro Webring.</section>
				<section>While being presented in a nearly identical format, the hand-drawn assets are intended to introduce collectors to the world of Stardrain; an island where monsters battle with weaponized audio frequencies controlled by aliens, cyborgs, and mutants who collect and train them.</section>

					<h1>Stardrain</h1>
					<section>
						Stardrain is a story that has been in development by KOOL SKULL since as far back as 2007.
						<br><br>
						Throughout an eventful career in Hollywood entertainment, this story has been developed in secret in order to be independently produced as an animated cyberpunk musical in a way that has never before seen, and would never be developed by studios with run-of-the-mill production methods.
						<br><br>
						MiAlien Maker is the first official time these character designs and concepts are being presented to the public.
						<br><br>
						More exposition is planned in the near future, but first a bridge must be built.
					</section>
					<section>3000 years into the future, Earth has changed in completely unrecognizable ways.
						<br><br>
							Covered in toxic waste and abandoned by most forms of sentient life, Earth has been renamed to "FubbX+FN" and designated by the Galactic Federation as a "Trash Planet".
						<br><br>
							Because of this dismissive designation, FubbX+FN is so rarely ever considered by visitors unless a transport is delivering a payload of unusable waste or toxic cargo. 
					</section>
					<section>
						Although this may sound grim and pessimistic at first, it turns out that this planet provided a great loophole and long-term hideout for political dissidents and inter-dimensional outlaws.
						<br><br>
						On FUbbX+FN, is an island that has been carefully developed by the green alien "Hollywood Cowboy".
						<br><br>
						Hollywood Cowboy spent over one thousand years developing a unique family of genetically modified Cryptogenetic synthesizer modulating botany, and musically weaponized creatures called Blasterbeasts on an Island called Stardrain.
					</section>
					<section>
						Cryptogenetic Fruit is the term coined by Hollywood Cowboy for a type of fruit that has information stored within it's cellular anatomy.
						<br><br>
						Each plant in this botcanical family keeps petabytes of decentralized information within it's DNA, serving as a natural cloud storage system.
						<br><br>
						This storage method is called "IDTS" or the Inter-Dimensional Thrash System. Cryptographically maintaining bits of information withing physical biophotons in a way where only the original author of that data is capable of extracting it. 
					</section>
					<section>
						Encryption of data is secured with a 4096-bit encryption method using the Slimentologist alphabet.
						<br><br>
						There are 8 basic counting symbols in Slimentology, and these symbols are grouped in sets of four to represent one bit.
						<br><br>
						Although this information is complex and verbose, it is also as of yet fictitious, so don't worry too hard about understanding it right away.
						<br><br>
						The most important part is that this island has plants that store data, and a family of fruits and vegetables that work together as modular components of computing systems.
					</section>
					<section>
						These modular components include waveform generators, modulators, and step-sequencers for an array of creative possibilities.
						<br><br>
						When you explore Stardrain, the plants sing harmonious hums of generated tones and a landscape of randomized frequencies.
						<br><br>
						If you connect your visualizer moduiles to the outputs of these plants, you will see some magnificent naturally generated graphics; more psychedelic and unique than any digital glitch vizualiser you have ever seen.
					</section>
					<section>
						On Stardrain, our green protagonist (Hollywood Cowboy) has built an array of buildings in a small city on the south side, and a Hotel on the north called "The Stardrain Hotel".
						<br><br>
						The city on the south side and the Hotel on the north are separated by half-moon shaped lake, and connected by a mysterious train that sometimes stops at stations that are in different dimensions.
					</section>
					<section>
						Stardrain has it's own economic environment that is maintained by an army of 44,000 tiny cyborg ants at tiny offices located in an unnoticable ant hill.
						<br><br>
						These robotic ants are sentient, but completely content with their jobs as virtual assistants, accountants, bots, and programmers for automated market making software on the Inter-Dimensional web.
						<br><br>
						Hollywood Cowboy designed these ants to interact with the outside world by providing useful services to digital environments while maintaining secrecy about their origin.
						<br><br>
						These ants serve as a way for perpetual funding of projects on Stardrain as well as the most dynamic virtual assistants ever to be created.
					</section>
					<section>
						Among this population of tiny cyborg ants, there is one whom is particularly uncomfortable with his duties that every other co-worker seems to be absolutely content with; 2K4D.
						<br><br>
						2K4D is another protagonist of this story because he is designed to be the first ant in the colony to leave, and explore the outside world in one thousand years.
						<br><br>
						He has invented a giganto-ray that requires materials from the outside world to complete, but his journey is not what we are here to learn about just yet. (this comes next!)
					</section>
				</section>
				<section><h1>Thrash Dimension</h1>
					<section>
						If we zoom out of the world of FubbX+FN and Stardrain, we find a much more confusing place called the Thrash Dimension.
					</section>
					<section>
						The Thrash dimension is an infinite space where objects appear seemingly randomly, and strange creatures roam. It can be traveled to by non-specific means, only by Thrash frequencies.
					</section>
					<section>
						In this dimension are large amorphous beings floating in the sky and below landmasses. 
						<br><br>
						Inhabiting this place are many thousands of ageless aliens who spend their time skateboarding and making music with eachother.
					</section>
					<section>
						In the Thrash dimension, there are piles of objects that appear from other dimensions which can be used by these aliens in various ways.
						<br><br>
						For example, if a block of stone randomly appears, Thrash Aliens will attempt to skateboard on it and film their attempts on videotape.
						<br><br>
						There is not a formal economic system in this world, there are only unpredictable appearances of objects and the care-free aliens who skate and enjoy their time there.
					</section>
					<section>
						Stardrain exists as a videogame cartridge found by these aliens in the Thrash dimension.
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>MiAlien Maker</h1>
					<section>
						Mialien Maker is a collection of neochibi portraits of the aliens who live in the Thrash Dimension.
					</section>
					<section>
						Each Alien has a different sense of fashion and wields an item from either the Thrash dimension or Stardrain.
					</section>
					<section>
						MiAlien Maker is intended to introduce this new world to humans involved in the world of digital collectibles.
						<br><br>
						If you are uptight about commonplace human concerns such as identity politics, social injustice, racism, or similar mind-control propaganda campaigns, MiAlien Maker is not for you.
						<br><br>
						We cannot be racist, we are aliens.
						<br><br>
						Your concerns are not our concerns, we exist elsewhere.
					</section>
					<section>
						Mialien Maker consists of seemingly rude humor in order to gatekeep the portal from easily emotionally manipulated humans.
						<br><br>
						Rude humor is not the main goal of the series, but if it keeps posers out, it is necessary.
					</section>
					<section>
						To humans, their subjective groups are such heated points of contention. This obviously relates to many different dimensions; Green versus Purple, Angler versus Cephalopod, Reptilian versus humanoid.
						<br><br>
						Everybody tends to prefer their own type, and when we have emotionally charged communities, we will have arguments, of course, but it really seems to be kicked into overdrive in your dimension.
					</section>
					<section>
								Before you go on and start pointing the finger at particular groups on your planet, remember that many of your leaders who write the social propaganda amd mind control campaigns in your realm are lead by ultra-terrestrial entities who go mostly unnoticed.
